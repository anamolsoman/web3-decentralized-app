## How to Use

### 1. Connect Wallet
When you open the CryptoBrew app, you’ll be prompted to connect your Web3 wallet (MetaMask, for example). This is essential for both creators and supporters to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

### 2. Generate Payment Link (For Creators)
If you’re a creator, navigate to the "Generate Link" page, where you can input a name and message and generate a custom payment link. The link will be unique to you, and your supporters can use it to send payments.

### 3. Send Payment (For Supporters)
As a supporter, you can visit any creator's payment link and send a secure payment using your Ethereum wallet. Your transaction will be processed instantly, and the funds will be sent directly to the creator’s wallet.

### 4. View Transaction History (For Creators)
Creators can view the history of received payments through the app, which is fetched directly from the Ethereum blockchain.
